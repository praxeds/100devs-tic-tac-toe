      -notification window has an input field for the player(s) name
       and a start button
  ->3rd stage gameboard
      -triggered when a player clicks start
      -displays an empty gameboard with player name(s) below X and O
      -random player starts at this point
  ->4th stage gameboard
      -triggered when a player wins or draws
      -gameboard is full of X and O at this point
